http://www.panda3d.org/manual/index.php/Running_your_Program

[-------------------------CONTROLS:--------------------------]

-press W,A,S,D to move forward,left,back,right (respectively).

-use the mouse to look around.

-press left mouse button to activate balloons and open doors (when close enough).

-hold right mouse button to zoom in.

-hold tab to see top view.

-press escape to quit.

[---------------------FOR BEST EXPERIENCE:-------------------]

If you run Life in a Box as is, your experience will be bland, as you will 
see a plain white maze with no background music or pictures when you click
on the balloon.

To get the best experience out of Life in a Box, do as follows:

1) Place whatever pictures you want (.jpg or .png) in the myPictures folder. (up to 50)

2) Place whatever music you want (.wav, .mp3 or .ogg) in the myMusic folder. (up to 10)

3) Place whatever maze textures you want (.jpg or .png) in the mazeTex folder. (up to 20)

Now when you run Life in a Box, when you click on the balloon, you will see a very colorful
maze filled with all the wonderful little pictures you provided along with background
music covering all the music you provided.  Much better, aye?

[-------------------------NOTES:-----------------------------]

A few things to note:

-This program requires a decently powerful computer to run smoothly!

-Do not add more media than the recommended limit.
	While technically possible to go over the recommended limit, the program 
	will run EXTREMELY slowly, unless you have a very powerful computer.

-Try to keep every picture in myPictures and mazeTex below 1024x1024 pixels.  
	It will technically still work if otherwise, but very slowly
	unless you have a very good video card.

-The image format for every picture must be in RGB, not greyscale or indexed.  
	If you do not know what this is, don't worry about it.  
	Most images are already in RGB format. (If you are completely blank pictures
	in frames, that means the image is either indexed or in greyscale!)

-If you do not know what a maze texture is, read below:
	A texture is basically a wallpaper that is (preferably) repeatable on all sides.
	See the provided samples in the mazeTex folder to see what maze textures are like. 
	(They do not have to be black and white!)

-Try not to add music that is greater than 5 minutes in length.
	It will still run, but very slowly unless you have a very good sound card.

-DO NOT MODIFY OR REMOVE ANY OTHER FILES.
	Virtually every other file not in myPictures, myMusic, or mazeTex is 
	required for Life in a Box to run.

-Have fun!
